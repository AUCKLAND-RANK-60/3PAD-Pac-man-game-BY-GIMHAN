# 3PAD-Pac-man-game-BY-GIMHAN
ReadMe — GIMHANS FINAL

Instructions on how to use this code:

Required Libraries:
- Pillow
- Pygame
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (comes built-in with Python)

Make sure these libraries are installed before running the code. You can install them using pip:

pip install pillow
pip install pygame

Tkinter is already included with Python, so no need to install it separately unless you manually removed it.



How to Run:

1. Make sure all images (like the background and character PNGs) and sound files (like Pacman_Original_Theme.mp3) are in the **same folder** as the code.

2. Open the Python file named:
   3PAD_CODE_GIMHAN_Window_added_combined_game_(1.1.0) (Backup)

3. Run the file using your Python editor (IDLE, VS Code, or terminal).

4. The login window will appear first — either log in or create a new account using the "Sign up" button.

5. Choose a difficulty mode to start the game:
   - Easy: Basic BEDMAS questions
   - Medium: Area questions with image prompts
   - Hard: Fraction questions

6. Use the arrow keys to move Pac-Man.
   Avoid ghosts and answer maths questions when they pop up.

7. Your score will be saved and shown in the scoreboard window after the game ends.



If something goes wrong:
- Check if the images are missing or named differently.
- Make sure your installed libraries match the list above.
- Try running the code again in a different Python editor.
